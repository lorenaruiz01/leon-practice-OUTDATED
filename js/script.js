//EASY
// create a variable and assign it a number
    let num = 1

//minus 10 from that number
    num = num - 10

//print that number to the console
    console.log (num)
        //log(num): here, log is a function and num is an argument, meaning you can pass a variable into a function as an argument

//MEDIUM
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
    let inputedVal = document.querySelector('#danceDanceRevolution').value

//add 25 to that number
    inputedVal = inputedVal + 25
    // or: inputedVal += 25 (different syntax)   

//alert that number
    alert(inputedVal)
    // alert is a function, but it is built-in to JS, so it is technically a method. a method is a function that is tied to an object. the whole thing (alert(inputed Val)) is a function call. By alerting 'inputedVal' we are passing in a value and that value is our argument. 


//HARD
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
